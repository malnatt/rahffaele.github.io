  			<p>A quantitative survey, designed by BCG along with the client in the early phases of the project, will map the service/product experience. The survey will be converted in a CSV file. The CSV file’s data will fuel the content of the digital map. The structure of the journey is designed as usual by a designer in the dedicated section of the tool.</p>

  		</div>
  		<div class="right-column">
  			<h3>The Overview</h3>
  			<p>It coincides with the landing page for the client. It is an overview of their journey. Its purpose is to show the journey from a high point of view, visualising at first sight the overall customer experience, differentiated by behavioural clusters, and get an idea of their high and low points. Relevance is given to the business goals. In this view, the visualisation leans more on the narrative of the journey rather than the diagnostic purpose.</p>
  			<h3>The Focused view</h3>
  			<p>In this view the user can dive in and specifically look for what is or isn’t working properly along the journey, comparing and analysing the different moments that act along it. It is a detailed visualisation of every moment of the customer experience.</p>
  			<p>For its purpose, the focused view uses two different level of visualisation, the first one that shows the curves and the second one that hides them when the user scrolls down, focusing exclusively on the moments.</p>
